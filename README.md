# Shoebot Atom extension

This Atom package works with [Shoebot](https://github.com/shoebot/shoebot),
which needs to be installed in your system.

Along with syntax highlighting and Shoebot file type, this package provides these
commands:

- Run (`Ctrl-Alt-R`): Run the open sketch on a window
- Export (`Ctrl-Alt-E`): Run and save the output to a file (SVG, PNG or PDF)
- Export video: Run and save to an MP4 file

These commands are also available in the Packages menu or (better) on the
right-click context menu.

## Install and setup

Be sure to set the directory where Shoebot was installed. The
default is `~/virtualenvs/shoebot/bin/sbot`, which should work if you
installed Shoebot using the recommended [Virtualenvwrapper
method](https://docs.shoebot.net/install.html#local-install-using-virtualenvwrapper).

## Troubleshooting

This extension is very new, so it's likely that you might run into issues while
trying it out. Please [make an issue](https://github.com/shoebot/atom-shoebot/issues/new) with the details and we'll help you out.
